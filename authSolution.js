Instead of solely relying on `onAuthStateChanged`, implement a more robust solution that combines `onAuthStateChanged` with additional checks using `currentUser`. This approach addresses potential timing inconsistencies and provides a more reliable indication of the current authentication state.  
```javascript
import { getAuth, onAuthStateChanged } from "firebase/auth";

const auth = getAuth();

// Improved Authentication State Handling
onAuthStateChanged(auth, (user) => {
  if (user) {
    // User is signed in, see docs for a list of available properties
    // https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/firebase.User
    const uid = user.uid;
    // ...
  } else {
    // User is signed out
    // ...
  }
});

// Additional check for immediate user status:
const currentUser = auth.currentUser;
if (currentUser) {
  // User is currently signed in
  console.log("User is currently signed in:", currentUser);
}
```
