This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Firebase Authentication where the `onAuthStateChanged` listener fails to reliably reflect authentication status changes.  The `authBug.js` file showcases the problematic behavior. The solution, found in `authSolution.js`, addresses this issue using a more robust approach to managing authentication state changes.  This is critical for applications where immediate, accurate authentication status is essential.
